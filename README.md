A McDonalds Drivethrough Simulation
Here I have made the simulation of the famous McDonalds drivethrough system which is implemented and used in many countries.
Here is what a Drive Through means- You can take your car to the first window where you can place your order. Then you move on to the next window to pay for your meal. The final and third window is where you collect your order. All these windows are situated on the circumference of the restaurant. While following the windows, you encircle the restaurant and after collecting your order, you can continue driving on the road.

There is an ultrasonic sensor that senses if there is a vehicle coming. If there is a vehicle detected, it sends signal to a servo motor in order to open a barricade so that the vehicle may pass.

Then the vehicle goes at window-1 where order can be placed. There are four icons for four menu items and there is an IR sensor placed beneath each icon. The customer waves in front of the sensor respective to the menu item and thus the order for that item is placed. Here wave refers to moving the hand in front of the sensor.

On the output side, (window-2) we will have four LEDs corresponding to the same menu items. If a particular item is delivered, its LED will glow.

When a vehicle is detected at the final window, another ultrasonic sensor sends signal to another servo to open the barricade so that the vehicle may leave. After a particular delay, it should close again.
